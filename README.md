## Development Process
### Contextualizing

#### Initial Ideas
These days, everyone, in every industry, needs a website to be competitive. <br> It was very difficult for me to develop a clear idea of how to present my CV. At first, I did not know to which IT area to direct the information.<br>The initial idea was create to just one big HTML document, and I started doing random animations with Javascript and React, but this was terribly difficult due to the very low handling I have at the moment. <br> I sat down and reconsidered how to do the project. And I discovered that I am good at posing and organizing tasks. <br> I decided to orient my CV to project management in, more professional way, therefore I made simple animations with CSS and Boostrap management for the more complicated animations.

#### Layout
The main idea behind this design was blocks of animated text content rather than a large amount of continuous content, which gave the website much more than was previously unavailable. <br>Responsiveness is one of the characteristics that I take into account, and layers that were important that can be easily seen on screens of all sizes were the key, as were some basic ideas that are highly effective for their information-rich simplicity.
I added in basic styles to edit the body, header, and footer such as font family, colour, align, margin, etc.<br>
A top or bottom navigation bar allows items in the center to carry more visual weight than all items on the side of the fold, in fact, it conserves more vertical page space than left navigation. I decided to use horizontal navigation at the bottom because of my first image on the home page - my items in the center, descending a mountain, it goes with the flow of the idea from top to bottom visualizing.

We can divide the site into 4 small parts:
1. Menu - Home site
2. Background animation - About site
3. Timeline and Progress Bar (Bootstrap) - Resumen site
4. Cards - Contact site

#### Libraries and Frameworks used
• Bootstrap
• CSS

#### Colour
What are the best colors for a resume? There is no simple answer to this question. I considering that resume colors depend on the profession you are applying for and the impression you want to make. My CV was oriented towards project management, therefore more professional and neutral. Using black, white, and a third color (like blue, pink, or yellow) is a safe color scheme for any resume. Try to make a dominant color black, secondary white, and use the third to highlight the important parts. <br>
Also according to what was studied in class, black is the color of sophistication and elegance, I wanted my CV to have that detail and be connected with a personality with the following characteristics: serious, confident, strong, determined, emotionally contained, and introverted.

#### Issues Faced/Solved
My first problem was the navigation bar, my connections with Bootstrap were differents versions. After a consultation with the lecturer, pointed the mistake. I linked with the differents versions.
