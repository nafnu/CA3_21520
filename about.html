          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>A natural person and problem solver. I have gone through a number of phases in my career, 
            each of which has informed my current work ethic and philosophy. That's why I would like to focus on management now - looking at the big picture,
            finding the right people to do various tasks, and making sure they have everything they need to do it successfully and efficiently. 
            I believe that my main asset is my ability to adapt to any challenge that comes my way.
